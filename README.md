# Data mining and ML models with Apache Spark 

The project involved developing a machine learning application using Spark MLlib within the Azure Synapse Analytics environment. This included data analysis, preprocessing, and model training to create a robust and scalable solution for predictive analytics.

## ‚õèÔ∏èüìä Data mining

- Data was analyzed using a some SQL for relational queries and Spark for detailed processing, ensuring deeper insights into the dataset.
- Some temporal tables were created to facilitate queries with different programming languages.
- To enhance data comprehension and presentation, a variety of graphs were generated.

## ‚úè Classification model
- Data underwent pre-processing, including the application of one-hot encoding to categorical variables, ensuring compatibility with the classification model.
- Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Spark MLlib, a classification model was trained on the pre-processed data, enabling accurate prediction and analysis of the dataset.
